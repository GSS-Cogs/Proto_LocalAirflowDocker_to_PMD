Ensure Docker / Composer is installed and operational.
Use a Terminal in your IDE to check with:
  docker --version
  docker-compose --version

Optional - depending on Airflow updates / installation version etc.
The .yaml for for Airflow is already part of this package - refresh ONLY should you need via the terminal:
  curl -LfO 'https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/2.5.3/docker-compose.yaml'

Ensure directories are present - dags, logs and plugins.

Run via your Terminal:
 docker compose up airflow-init

* No need to run - I've built an .env for you: echo -e "AIRFLOW_UID=$(id -u)" > .env

Run ((-d for detached)):
 docker-compose up -d 

Check status and Airflow web interface:
  docker ps
Look for Port (should be default 0.0.0.0:8080 -  pop that into Browser)
